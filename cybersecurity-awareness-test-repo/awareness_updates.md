# Software Updates & Patch Management

**Why updates matter:**
Updates and patches fix security vulnerabilities that attackers may exploit.

**Recommended actions:**
- Keep operating systems, applications, and firmware up to date.
- Apply critical security patches promptly.
- Use automatic updates where appropriate.
- Test patches in a controlled environment for business-critical systems before wide rollout.
