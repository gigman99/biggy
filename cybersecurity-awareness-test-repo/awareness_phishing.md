# Phishing Awareness

**What is phishing?**
Phishing is a type of attack where scammers attempt to trick you into revealing sensitive information
(passwords, credit card numbers, organization credentials) by pretending to be a trusted entity.

**How to spot phishing:**
- Unexpected requests for credentials or personal information.
- Poor grammar, spelling mistakes, or odd sender addresses.
- Links that don’t match the displayed text — hover to preview.
- Urgent or threatening language asking you to act quickly.

**What to do:**
- Don’t click suspicious links; open sites by typing the known URL.
- Verify requests by contacting the sender through a known-good channel.
- Report phishing emails to your IT/security team.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
