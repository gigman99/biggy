# Password Security

**Best practices for passwords:**
- Use a long passphrase (12+ characters) with mixed words and symbols.
- Avoid reusing passwords across sites.
- Use a reputable password manager to store and generate unique passwords.
- Prefer passphrases over single words (e.g., 'Blue.Coffee.2025!').

**Additional steps:**
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- Change passwords immediately if you suspect compromise.
- Avoid sharing passwords over email or chat.
